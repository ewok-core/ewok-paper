We envision the EWoK framework as a useful resource to probe the understanding of basic world knowledge in language models. However, to enable the broader research community to best make use of this resource, it is important that we have a shared understanding of how to use it most effectively. This document outlines our vision for keeping the resource as accessible and open as possible, while also protecting it from intentional or unintentional misuse.


1. DEFINITIONS/GLOSSARY.
For more information about each of these terms, please refer to the EWoK paper linked from <https://ewok-fmwk.github.io>.
Configuration files, Config files, Materials: these refer to the (currently YAML-formatted) materials consisting of Concepts, Contexts, Targets, Fillers (explained in the paper) that define specific concepts to test, the sentences and contexts in which they are used to test them, and all adjoining metadata providing information about how they should be combinatorially combined with one another to generate items in an instance of an EWoK dataset.
The EWoK framework, EWoK, the framework: these terms all refer to the collection of the configuration files and the code that processes them into a dataset of items to evaluate language models on.
Templates: These are the result of compiling Config files through the EWoK framework. Concepts and Contexts are put together with Targets to generate item-templates involving variables like “{agent1}” where Concepts are deployed. These templates can be filled in by the EWoK framework in a second step to generate actual items.  
Dataset, instance of a dataset, items: a specific instantiation of a dataset resulting from a set of configuration files and parameters to the EWoK framework (such as how many fillers to use per template), the resultant templates, and then filling into those templates again to finally produce a set of items to evaluate language models on. The specific instance of dataset used in the EWoK paper is named EWoK-core-1.0, and is described in the EWoK paper (https://ewok-fmwk.github.io).
Foundation Models, Language Models, Large Language Models, LMs, LLMs, Models: [from Bommasani et al. 2021 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258>] (A [large language] model is any model that is trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) that can be adapted (e.g., fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks; current examples include BERT [Devlin et al. 2019], GPT-3 [Brown et al. 2020], and CLIP [Radford et al. 2021]. For our purposes, any model involving a language component in its pre-training/training in any modality (whether text-based, visual, or speech) falls into this definition.


2. PURPOSE.
Intended use: We envision the EWoK framework and any current and resulting future datasets as a useful resource to probe the understanding of basic world knowledge, or the core building blocks of world knowledge, in language models. We also enable the community to use/adapt the framework to generate their own datasets that may be more specialized in scope than the EWoK-1.0 dataset.
Our release-related goals are to (a) reduce the chances of accidental incorporation of EWoK items into LLMs’ training data and (b) promote accountability and reporting when such incorporation is done intentionally.
Our intention is not to restrict access; on the contrary, we want to promote open science and widespread use of this resource. However, we want to prevent unintentional leaking of the data and inclusion in LM’s pre-training or training data rendering EWoK less useful as an evaluation resource for these models for future use.

EXPLICIT ATTRIBUTION FOR USE TRAINING DATA/FOR USE OTHER THAN EVALUATION: We require that any LM/LLM/FM (see definitions above) incorporating any portion of EWoK generated materials in its pre-training/training/fine-tuning data must explicitly and prominently acknowledge doing so.

Model card: in your model’s descriptor “card”; for examples and a description of what a model card is, see: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993>, <https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards>
README/Repository: prominently acknowledge using EWoK and EWoK-generated materials in the relevant README document of your model’s release. If your model lives on GitHub, Huggingface, or another software/model weights hosting platform, make sure the acknowledgment is visible there. See below for a suggested acknowledgment blurb.


4. SUGGESTED ACKNOWLEDGMENT BLURB (EXAMPLE).
“We acknowledge that our model was trained on data generated from the EWoK framework <https://ewok-fmwk.github.io>. Specifically we included the EWoK-core-1.0 dataset reported in the EWoK paper (Ivanova, Sathe, Lipkin, et al., 2024) as part of our training data.”
